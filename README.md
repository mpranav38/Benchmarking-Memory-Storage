First I tried with python for the 1 gb size and i have marked all the outputs in the repo when i tried 64 gb file size i run it for almost 3 days but still recieved error message saying "KILLED".

I have also submitted my rust file which is in hashgenone folder. I couldnt generate hashes because i was out of time. But the program is running perfectly.

to run the experiment of python file please type "bash run_experiments.sh" in command prompt
'
to run the rust file go to hashgenone/src enter command prompt "cargo run -- ..............." with the required threads or to automate type "benchmarking.sh"
